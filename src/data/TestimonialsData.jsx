    text: "My time working with Shruti was on a very challenging project that saw multiple group members leave the group before important deadlines. Thankfully, by staying level-headed and by collaborating closely with myself, we were able to pull through and deliver on time. We were only able to succeed due to Shruti's fantastic work ethic and strong software engineering skills. I wholeheartedly recommend her for any software development role you have open.",

      "It is with much enthusiasm that I recommend Shruti Sharma for any Software Engineering role." +
      " I have worked alongside Shruti for many months as a fellow engineer at Gallify. While working at Gallify, she displayed many great qualities that I believe highly qualify her for all software engineering roles. Rare abilities that we often look for in engineers include high levels of creativity, wit, and analytical thinking, all of which Shruti has shown in her time on our team." +
      " She has shown to be a person not scared of new challenges – while on our team, she utilized various coding languages and APIs, including Swift and Firebase. Furthermore, in many tough situations Shruti made correct decisions – when Shruti figured out how to properly use the Firebase API within a Swift MVVM architecture application, or when she helped our team reach a schema that was backwards compatible." +
      " Shruti stepped up to the plate many times throughout our app's time, and played a critical role in its development.",

    text:
      "Students in my English 282 class were asked to propose and conduct quarter-long autoethnographic research projects that involved both library (literature review and analysis) and field research (interviews, surveys, and observation). " +
      "Shruti excelled at every step of this process, which required a great deal of independent work, planning, collaboration, and creativity. She was self-motivated and intellectually engaged, and she did an outstanding job of communicating with me and meeting deadlines." +
      " Moreover, she consistently displayed advanced-level writing skills, both on in-class and take-home assignments." +
      "In fact, her final portfolio project on the experiences of undergraduate female computer science students at the University of Washington was so strong that I now use it as a student sample in other English courses." +
      "Moreover, Shruti’s showcase video from English 282, entitled “Gender Equality in Computer Science at the University,” was one of only three student submissions to be selected for a competitive prize and publication in our multidisciplinary online journal, Process.",
